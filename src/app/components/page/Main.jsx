							<h2 className="section-title">How Does Leasing Work?</h2>
							<p className="how-does__text">
								Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term
								rental agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car
								purchase, you donâ€™t actually own the vehicle. Instead, a leasing
								company purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and
								then you make monthly payments to the leasing company for the
								duration of your lease. Some leases however, do provide the
								option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease.
							</p>
							<h4 className="how-does__title">
								Similar to a short term car rental, there are rules that define:
							</h4>
							<ol className="how-does__list">
								<li className="how-does__item">
									<p className="how-does__item-text">
										How much you can drive, stated as annual miles (excess miles
										are charged at a specified rate)
									</p>
								</li>
								<li className="how-does__item">
									<p className="how-does__item-text">
										Types of damage that you may be liable for at the end of
										your lease
									</p>
								</li>
								<li className="how-does__item">
									<p className="how-does__item-text">
										The procedures and costs when you return the vehicle at the
										end of your lease
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p className="how-does__title">
								Lease contracts are a commitment and ending them early can be
								difficult and expensive so it is important to consider your
								circumstances carefully before you decide.
